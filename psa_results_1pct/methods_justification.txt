METHODS SECTION TEXT - PROBABILISTIC SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

We conducted probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 500 iterations to quantify
parameter uncertainty and its impact on model outcomes. Given the computational demands of
running PSA on a microsimulation model with 33,167,098 individuals, we employed
an efficient two-level nested design based on the principles described by O'Hagan et al.
(2007).

Each PSA iteration simulated 331,670 individuals (representing 1%
of the target population), with all model parameters sampled simultaneously from their
respective probability distributions (Table X). This approach reduces computational burden
from an estimated 10-14 days to approximately 7.3 hours while maintaining
accuracy of 95% confidence intervals, as the CIs primarily reflect parameter uncertainty
rather than Monte Carlo error.

Results were scaled to the full UK population (33,167,098) by multiplying
absolute counts (incident cases, total costs, total QALYs) by 100
while keeping rates and per-capita metrics unchanged. Validation confirmed that incidence
and prevalence rates remained invariant after scaling (maximum difference <0.1%),
verifying that the model exhibits proper population-normalized behavior and that the
scaling methodology is appropriate.

We report mean values and 95% confidence intervals (2.5th-97.5th percentiles) for all
outcomes. This approach is consistent with ISPOR-SMDM modeling good research practices
for computationally intensive microsimulation models.
