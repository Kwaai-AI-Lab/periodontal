METHODS SECTION TEXT - PROBABILISTIC SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS (V3: 65+ ONLY MODEL)
Periodontal Disease Prevalence: 25%

We conducted probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 500 iterations to quantify
parameter uncertainty and its impact on model outcomes. The analysis was performed with
periodontal disease prevalence set at 25%. This analysis uses the 65+ only
model version (population: 10,787,479). Given the computational demands of
running PSA on a microsimulation model with 10,787,479 individuals, we employed
an efficient two-level nested design based on the principles described by O'Hagan et al.
(2007).

Each PSA iteration simulated 107,874 individuals (representing 1%
of the target population), with all model parameters sampled simultaneously from their
respective probability distributions (Table X). This approach reduces computational burden
from an estimated 10-14 days to approximately 5.4 hours while maintaining
accuracy of 95% confidence intervals, as the CIs primarily reflect parameter uncertainty
rather than Monte Carlo error.

Results were scaled to the full UK 65+ population (10,787,479) by multiplying
absolute counts (incident cases, total costs, total QALYs) by 100
while keeping rates and per-capita metrics unchanged. Validation confirmed that incidence
and prevalence rates remained invariant after scaling (maximum difference <0.1%),
verifying that the model exhibits proper population-normalized behavior and that the
scaling methodology is appropriate.

We report mean values and 95% confidence intervals (2.5th-97.5th percentiles) for all
outcomes. This approach is consistent with ISPOR-SMDM modeling good research practices
for computationally intensive microsimulation models.
